# CoronaProject

This repository contains data analysis and modeling code for the Corona Project, an ongoing research project investigating the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Overview

The Corona Project is a collaborative effort involving researchers from multiple institutions and disciplines. The goal of the project is to better understand the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and to develop data-driven strategies for mitigating its impact.

The code in this repository includes data analysis scripts, data visualization tools, and machine learning models for predicting the spread of the virus and the effectiveness of various interventions.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files and directories:

- `data`: A directory containing raw and processed data files for the COVID-19 pandemic, including case counts, hospitalization rates, mortality rates, and other relevant metrics sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) database.

- `notebooks`: A directory containing Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization. These notebooks include exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and machine learning models.

- `scripts`: A directory containing Python scripts for data processing and cleaning.

- `models`: A directory containing trained machine learning models for predicting the spread of the virus and the effectiveness of interventions.

- `LICENSE`: A file containing the license under which this repository is distributed (MIT License).

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts in this repository, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and other required Python libraries (see requirements.txt)

## Usage

To run the Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts in this repository, you can clone the repository to your local machine and then open the notebooks or run the scripts using your preferred Python environment.

The data files in the `data` directory are sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) database and can be used as inputs to the data analysis and modeling scripts. The trained machine learning models in the `models` directory can be used to predict the spread of the virus and the effectiveness of interventions.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions and appreciate your feedback on the implementations.
